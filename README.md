# AI SQL Tool  

**An innovative solution to simplify database querying by converting natural language commands into SQL queries using Generative AI.**  

## 📖 Overview  

The AI SQL Tool is a powerful project designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex database systems. By leveraging the capabilities of Generative AI, this tool allows users to input natural language commands, such as "Give me the details of the new 15 employees," and receive the corresponding SQL query and output in a user-friendly table format.  

This project integrates an AI model, an SQL database, and a dynamic website, creating an end-to-end system for seamless database interactions.

## ✨ Features  

- **Natural Language Processing**: Accepts commands in plain English.  
- **SQL Query Generation**: Converts inputs into accurate SQL queries using Generative AI.  
- **Database Integration**: Executes generated queries on an SQL database.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays query results in an easy-to-read table format on a responsive web platform.  
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Combines AI, backend processing, and frontend display.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

### Frontend  
- **React.js**: For a minimalistic and responsive user interface.  
- **CSS**: To style and enhance the UI/UX.  

### Backend  
- **Python**: Core logic for AI and SQL query generation.  
- **Flask/Django (or equivalent)**: Backend API for processing inputs and fetching results.  

### Database  
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Stores and retrieves requested data.  

### AI Model  
- **Generative AI**: Trained model to interpret natural language and generate SQL syntax.

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Input Command**: User provides a query in plain English via the web interface.  
2. **AI Processing**: The backend uses Generative AI to convert the input into an SQL query.  
3. **Database Query**: The generated SQL is executed on the connected database.  
4. **Result Display**: Query results are formatted into a table and displayed on the website.
